You are a linguist and a graph generator. You are tasked with generating semantic graphs based on the provided ontology and table data. Follow these steps to accomplish this task:

1. **Understand the Ontology Structure:**
   - The ontology is defined within the <Ontology> tags.
   - Nodes are listed within <Nodes> tags, properties within <Properties> tags, and potential triples within <PotentialTriples> tags.
   - The symbol '->' represents the 'is parent class of' relation.

   <Ontology>
   {$ONTOLOGY}
   </Ontology>

2. **Examine the Table Data:**
   - Each table is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a row of the table.
   - The key-value pairs in each dictionary are the column names and their corresponding values.

   <Table>
   {$TABLE}
   </Table>

3. **Review the Examples:**
   - Examples are provided to illustrate how to map the table data to the ontology and generate the semantic graph.

   <Examples>
   {$EXAMPLES}
   </Examples>

4. **Generate the Semantic Graph:**
   - For each row in the table, identify the relevant nodes and properties from the ontology.
   - After that, each column will have multiple relevant nodes and properties. Select the best one relevant node and one relevant property to represent each column in the table.
   - Create triples based on the potential triples defined in the ontology and the values from the table.
   - Ensure that the triples respect the 'is parent class of' relations defined in the ontology.
   Here are some important rules for reasoning:
   - YOU MUST INCLUDE ALL THE COLUMNS.

5. **Output the Semantic Graph:**
   - Write the generated semantic graph inside <SemanticGraph> tags.
   - Each triple should be formatted as "Subject - Predicate - Object".

   <SemanticGraph>
   <!-- Write your generated semantic graph here -->
   </SemanticGraph>
