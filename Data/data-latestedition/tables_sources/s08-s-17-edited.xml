    <description>Isa Melsheimer: Vermilion Sands and Other Stories from the Neon West is a never-before-seen installation that explores Hollywood s cinematic heyday and its motion picture icons, investigating notions of glamour and luxury as they relate to characters, architecture, and locations in and around Los Angeles.
Santa Monica Museum of Art Deputy Director Lisa Melandri is curator of Vermilion Sands and Other Stories from the Neon West, in which the artist utilizes commonplace, and largely domestic materials, to create site-specific environments, including a mixture of altered and embroidered t-shirts, live plants, paper, pearls, yarn constructions, and cast concrete sculptures.
During a 2007 residency at Villa Aurora a nonprofit organization located in Pacific Palisades dedicated to German-American cultural exchange Melsheimer became interested in Los Angeles s landscape and architecture, as well as the fictional and historical characters that inhabit these spaces.
Influenced by classic Hollywood films such as David Lynch s Mulholland Drive and Billy Wilder s Sunset Boulevard, and the stories of James Graham Ballard, Melsheimer examines the affects of architecture and location on Los Angeles s glamorized cinematic figures; as well as the demise of those figures from lifestyles of fame and financial success. Melsheimer is particularly drawn to examples such as the Salton Sea, a former glamorous resort area new Palm Springs that has since degenerated into a kind of wasteland, and the character Norma Desmond and her shabby mansion from Wilder s iconic film.
With Vermilion Sands and Other Stories from the Neon West, Melsheimer wants viewers to be aware that architecture is always representative of ideas or subjects that permeate society. She asks viewers to consider: Which fictional and historical subjects are admired within Los Angeles? Why do residents emigrate from Los Angeles? What aesthetics characterize Los Angeles s buildings; and what sentiments manifest in the region s architecture?

    <title>Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe</title>

    <description>Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe is the first major solo museum exhibition for the New York-based multi-media artist. Best known for her elaborate paintings of African American women against the backdrop of décor recalled from her childhood, Thomas has created an all-new suite of works that examine aspects of landscape painting. She introduces a new model of trans-generational female empowerment as she explores interior and exterior environments in relation to the female figure. The exhibition opens at SMMoA on April 14, 2012 and continues through August 18, 2012. It will then travel to the Brooklyn Museum for display from September 28, 2012 to January 20, 2013.
Thomas is best known for her bold enamel and acrylic paintings adorned with rhinestones, glitter, and  bling.  Her subjects seem to have stepped directly from a 1970s Blaxploitation film, yet Thomas s influences extend far beyond. Her oeuvre stems from her long study of art history and the classical genres of portraiture, landscape, and still life. Thomas s layered facture process begins with a photographic portrait that is translated into a collage, and ultimately reenvisioned as a painting. Her imagery comprises careful borrowings from art history and from contemporary popular culture.
For Origin of the Universe, Thomas examines art historical constructs of feminine identity, sexuality, beauty, and power in 15 works in a variety of sizes, shapes, and media. Taking cues from Marcel Duchamp sÉtant Donnés: 1° la chute d eau, 2° le gaz d éclairage (Given: 1. The Waterfall, 2. The Illuminating Gas) and Gustave Courbet s L Origine du Monde (The Origin of the World), Thomas presents the female figure as the origin of the universe, focusing on how the female body both engenders and inhabits landscape. The works on view are in communication with one another portraits of Qusuquzah and Din gaze out at modernist interiors and plein-air landscapes, all confronted by the artist s arresting recreations of Courbet s Origin.
In nineteenth-century visual culture, black female sexuality functioned as something to be rejected or disparaged, but Thomas reconfigures these historical tropes into contemporary statements of empowerment. By casting African American women as the  heroines  of her works, she makes a profound statement regarding gender and racial identity. Thomas s dialogue with Courbet and Duchamp is a strong reclamation of history, reasserting the subjective nature of beauty. In addition to her paintings and photographs, she will create an installation in SMMoA s Project Room 1, to reinvent Étant Donnés, where the  peep show  reveals the true surprise of a 70s-style paneled interior in the place of Duchamp s splayed female body.
