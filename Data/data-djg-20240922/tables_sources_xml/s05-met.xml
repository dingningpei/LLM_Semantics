    <description>American baskets for bread, cake, or fruit are extremely rare. The monogram on the interior is for Susannah and Samuel Cornell. Myers made several objects for these wealthy patrons from New York and New Bern, North Carolina. According to the inscription on the underside of the basket, the Cornells later gave it to their daughter Hannah, who married Herman LeRoy on October 19, 1786.</description>

    <description>Derived from Dutch, Scandinavian, and English sources, brandywine bowls were used on festive occasions such as the kindermaal, when women gathered to welcome a newborn child. Following Dutch custom, a bowl would be filled with raisins and brandy and passed from guest to guest. Here, boldly chased tulips create a sumptuous effect. The bowl belonged to Theunis Jacobsen Quick, a wealthy baker, and his wife, Vroutje 4516 Janse Haring.</description>

    <who>Caleb Gardner</who>
    <description>Eighteenth-century easy chairs heavily padded, with thick down-filled cushions, and with wings to rest one's head against and keep drafts awayâ€”were often reserved for the elderly or the infirm. This New England example is remarkable for its elaborate upholstery and intact condition. The front is covered with Irish stitch needlework and the back with a needlework landscape scene. The seams are covered with silk tape. The frame is inscribed by \"Gardner Junr,\" presumably the upholsterer, and dated \"Newport, May 1758.\"</description>
